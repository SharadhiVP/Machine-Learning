DESCRIPTION OF THE TASKS:

Internship Project Description – CODTECH
As part of the CODTECH internship, you are required to complete four core machine learning and data science tasks. These projects span key domains such as classification, sentiment analysis, computer vision, and recommendation systems. Each task involves model building, evaluation, and documentation through Jupyter notebooks, with a certificate of completion issued at the end of the internship.

1. Decision Tree Classification
This task involves building and visualizing a Decision Tree model using Scikit-learn. You will select a suitable dataset for classification—such as the Iris dataset or Titanic survival data—and preprocess it to ensure model readiness. The goal is to train a Decision Tree Classifier to predict class labels based on input features. You will visualize the tree structure using tools like plot_tree() or graphviz, interpret feature importance, and evaluate model performance using accuracy, confusion matrix, and other metrics. The final deliverable is a Jupyter notebook showing all steps from data processing to model interpretation.

2. Sentiment Analysis with NLP
In this task, you will perform sentiment analysis on a dataset of customer reviews. Preprocessing involves cleaning the text data—removing stop words, punctuation, and applying tokenization. You will then convert the text into numerical form using TF-IDF vectorization, which measures the importance of words across the corpus. A Logistic Regression model will be trained to classify sentiments (positive, negative, or neutral). Evaluation will include accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix. The Jupyter notebook must clearly demonstrate preprocessing, vectorization, model training, and sentiment evaluation.

3. Image Classification with CNN
This project focuses on building a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using either TensorFlow or PyTorch for image classification. You will work with a labeled image dataset (e.g., MNIST or CIFAR-10), preprocess the images (resizing, normalization), and design a CNN architecture suited for the task. The model will be trained, validated, and tested to assess its ability to correctly classify images. Performance metrics like accuracy, loss, and confusion matrix will be used. The deliverable is a functional notebook or script demonstrating model design, training, and evaluation.

4. Recommendation System
The final task is to build a recommendation system using collaborative filtering or matrix factorization techniques such as Singular Value Decomposition (SVD). Using a dataset like MovieLens or an e-commerce dataset, you will predict user preferences and generate personalized recommendations. The notebook should include data processing, similarity computations or factorization, model training, and evaluation using metrics like RMSE or precision@k.
